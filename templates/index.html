            <p>Currently there is no effective unique identifier system for companies that operate within the U.S. This has huge implications for corporate accountability, disclosure in political giving, evaluation of systemic risk in financial markets, oversight of government contracts and more.</p>
            <p>Play with the visualization below to see how messy our current system is, read an overview of the <a href="{% url existing-identifiers %}">major federal systems</a> or find a <a href="{% url singapore-uen %}">case study</a> of one country that has successfully overcome this problem.</p>

				<p class="tip companyContent">The main corporate identifier that the federal government uses for grants and contracting is the DUNS number. There's several problems with DUNS numbers, but one issue is that their usage by the federal government is inconsistent. </p>

				<p class="tip companyContent">Often, one company's DUNS number is mistakenly entered for another company's DUNS number. Or, if two companies are on the same contract, only one of their DUNS numbers might be recorded. In order to show how tangled these connections are, we've created the visualization below.</p>

				<p class="tip companyContent">To see all the possible names and DUNS numbers associated a company name in USASpending.gov, enter that company's name in the search box.</p>

				<p id="viz-explain" class="clear tip companyContent">The graph is created by searching the <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov">USASpending.gov</a> database for contracts and grants that associate a name with a DUNS number or vice versa, repeating until it fails to find any new associations. Inaccuracies may result from name variations, a corporate restructuring not reflected in the D&amp;B data or from simple mis-use of DUNS numbers. Contract and grant details are available from USASpending.gov.</p>
