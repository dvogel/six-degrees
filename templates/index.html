            <p>Currently there is no effective unique identifier system for companies that operate within the US. This has huge implications for corporate accountability, disclosure in political giving, evaluation of systemic risk in financial markets, oversight of government contracts and more.</p>
            <p>Play with the visualization below, read an overview of the <a href="#">major federal systems</a>, or find a <a href="#">case study</a> of one country thatâ€™s successfully overcome this problem.</p>

				<p id="viz-explain" class="clear tip companyContent">The graph is created by searching the <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov">USASpending.gov</a> database for contracts and grants that associate a name with a DUNS number or vice versa, repeating until it fails to find any new associations. Inaccuracies may result from name variations, a corporate restructing not reflected in the D&amp;B data, or from simple mis-use of DUNS numbers. Contract and grant details are available from USASpending.gov.</p>
