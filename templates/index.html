<h2>Unique Corporate Identifiers</h2>
<p>
There are millions of corporations in the United States today. They span many industries, and have an enormous impact on the economy, education, social services and the democratic process. In many ways, they are legal entities that have the same responsibilities as individuals. However, while individuals can be uniquely identified by a social security number, unique identification a of corporation is much more nebulous. There is not a single number you can use or authority you can ask, to know if the First National Bank of Atlanta is the same entity as the First National Bank of St. Louis. Answering that question would require manual cross-examination against other contextual information. The lack of a unique identifier for corporations has huge implications for corporate accountability, disclosure in political giving, evaluation of systemic risk in financial markets, oversight of government contracts and more.

<p>
Currently, the United States government has several disparate systems for uniquely identifying a corporation, subsidiaries of that corporation, or when one corporation merges into another. There are also many private companies that compile, market and sell similar information. The need for this information is clearly demonstrated, which is why there are so many expensive and competing efforts to address it in both the public and private sectors. However, many of these systems have been developed for narrow and specific uses, such as tracking defense contracts, tax reporting, identifying publicly traded companies, EPA violations, or general government contracting. If a publicly traded company were to contract with the federal government, it is very likely that they would have to be assigned and maintain an identifier from each of these categories, resulting in inefficiencies and unnecessary overhead in their interactions with the government. Even if all of these systems were used exactly as they were intended, there would still be a problem. 
</p>
<p>
All of these identifiers are mostly present at a federal level. State or local level identifiers also vary widely, with at least one system or numbering scheme per state. State business registrations are often treated individually, and are not cross-referenced with other state or federal data. All of these unaligned efforts create duplicative work and make it difficult to prevent corporate misconduct that is often repeated at local, state and federal levels.
